DNP3 (IEEE-1815) is the most common SCADA protocol in North America. It is primarily used in electric power 
to monitor and control field assets. DNP3 differs from simple request / response protocols such as Modbus in important ways:

* DNP3 makes efficient use by bandwidth by transferring only points that have changed since the last request or in a purely event-driven *unsolicited* mode.
* Events may be time-tagged at the source of the measurement to millisecond accuracy.
* Measurement *variations* are specified to avoid the ad hoc nature of how non-16-bit values are encoded in multiple Modbus registers. For example, analog
values in DNP3 may be exchanged as signed 16-bit integers, signed 32-bit integers, single precision floats, or double precision floats.
* DNP3 is not purely request-response and is quite complex.

## The Standard

If you plan to develop or deploy a product that uses DNP3, a copy of the standard will be indispensable. A copy may be purchased from the
[DNP3 Users Group](https://dnp.org) or [IEEE](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1815-2012.html). We recommend that you join the user group to obtain a copy
of the standard as this provides access to a wealth of additional documents and a forum.
