This guide provides the primary documentation for Step Function I/O's DNP3 [library](https://github.com/stepfunc/dnp3). Here you'll find:

* Which parts of DNP3 the library implements
* How to use the library's Application Programming Interface (API)
* How the API maps to DNP3 concepts
* How to get pre-built binary distributions of the library for supported languages
* How to build the core Rust library and bindings from the source

You can find exhaustive details for every field, method, and argument to the language-specific API documentation here:

* <a href={`https://docs.stepfunc.io/dnp3/${sitedata.version}/rust/dnp3/`}>Rust (rustdoc)</a>
* <a href={`https://docs.stepfunc.io/dnp3/${sitedata.version}/c/dnp3_8h.html`}>C (doxygen)</a>
* <a href={`https://docs.stepfunc.io/dnp3/${sitedata.version}/java/`}>Java (javadoc)</a>
* <a href={`https://docs.stepfunc.io/dnp3/${sitedata.version}/dotnet/namespacednp3.html`}>C# (doxygen)</a>

In addition to this documentation, you can find example programs in the source repository that demonstrate the most common API features for each language.

## IEEE-1815

Please note that while this guide covers some DNP3 concepts, it doesn't replicate the DNP3 standard itself. If you plan to develop a product that uses DNP3, a copy of the standard is indispensable. Purchase your copy from [DNP3 Users Group](https://dnp.org) or [IEEE](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1815-2012.html).

If you join the user group to get your copy of the standard you'll also get access to additional valuable documentation along with a forum.
