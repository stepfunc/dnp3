This guide is the primary documentation for Step Function I/O's DNP3 [library](https://github.com/stepfunc/dnp3). It covers:

* What parts of DNP3 the library implements
* How to use the library's Application Programming Interface (API)
* How the API maps to DNP3 concepts
* Where to obtain pre-built binary distributions of the library for supported languages
* How to build the core Rust library and the bindings from source

The guide defers the exhaustive details of every field, method, and argument to the language-specific API documentation
extracted from the source code itself:

* <a href={`https://docs.stepfunc.io/dnp3/${sitedata.version}/rust/dnp3/`}>Rust (rustdoc)</a>
* <a href={`https://docs.stepfunc.io/dnp3/${sitedata.version}/c/dnp3_8h.html`}>C (doxygen)</a>
* <a href={`https://docs.stepfunc.io/dnp3/${sitedata.version}/java/`}>Java (javadoc)</a>
* <a href={`https://docs.stepfunc.io/dnp3/${sitedata.version}/dotnet/namespacednp3.html`}>C# (doxygen)</a>

In addition to the documentation, example programs may be found in the source repository that demonstrate the usage
of the most common API features for each language.

## IEEE-1815

If you plan to develop a product that uses DNP3, a copy of the standard will be indispensable. A copy may be purchased from the
[DNP3 Users Group](https://dnp.org) or [IEEE](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1815-2012.html). We recommend that you join the user group to obtain a copy
of the standard as this provides access to a wealth of additional documents and a forum.

This guide is not a replacement for the DNP3 standard itself. While it covers some DNP3 concepts, the standard is over 800 pages in length and cannot be
replicated here.
