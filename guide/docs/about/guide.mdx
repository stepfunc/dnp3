This guide is the user manual for Step Function I/O's [DNP3 library](https://github.com/stepfunc/dnp3). It covers:

* What parts of DNP3 the library implements
* How to use the library's Application Programming Interface (API)
* How the API maps to DNP3 concepts
* Where to obtain pre-built binary distributions of library for supported languages
* How to build the library for platforms/architectures where binary distributions are not available.




## The Standard

If you plan to develop or deploy a product that uses DNP3, a copy of the standard will be indispensable. A copy may be purchased from the
[DNP3 Users Group](https://dnp.org) or [IEEE](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/1815-2012.html). We recommend that you join the user group to obtain a copy
of the standard as this provides access to a wealth of additional documents and a forum.

This guide is not a replacement for the DNP3 standard itself. While it covers some DNP3 concepts, the standard is over 800 pages in length and cannot be
replicated here.
