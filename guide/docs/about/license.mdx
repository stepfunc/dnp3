The library is made available publicly under a non-commercial/non-production license for the purposes of evaluation, research and development, and education.
While we follow many many of the same practices (public source/development), the library is not "open source" per the strict definition defined by the
[Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd).

We license the library for commercial applications on a royalty-free basis. Please contact us via our [website](https://stepfunc.io/contact/) if you wish to
receive a quotation for your product.
