We have made our library publicly available under a non-commercial/non-production license for the purposes of evaluation, research and development, and education.
While we follow many of the same practices (public source/development), our library is not "open source" per the strict definition defined by the
[Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd).

We license the library for commercial applications using two different licensing models:

* per-product royalty-free licensing
* per-unit licensing

Please contact us via our [website](https://stepfunc.io/contact/) for pricing.
