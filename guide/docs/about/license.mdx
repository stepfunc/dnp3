Our library is publicly available under a non-commercial/non-production license for the purposes of evaluation, research and development, and education.
While we follow many of the same practices (public source/development), our library is not "open source" per the strict definition set forth by the
[Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/osd).

We offer royalty-free commercial licensing with flexible payment options.

Please contact us via our [website](https://stepfunc.io/contact/) for pricing.
