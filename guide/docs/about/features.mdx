import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

This library implements both DNP3 outstation and master functionality in a single package. The core library is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). We
use a model-based approach to generate bindings for C, Java, and C# bindings.



## Design goals

* The library is memory-safe, and many potential defects are eliminated at compile-time including buffer overflows, use-after free, and dangling pointers.
You can read more about Rust and our approach to secure software engineering on [our website](https://stepfunc.io/about/why-rust/).
* CPU and memory efficiency:
  * Heap allocations are avoided whenever possible
  * Parsing is zero-copy and never allocates
  * Thousands of concurrent communication sessions can execute on a single server
* Provides a high-level API that makes writing DNP3 conformant applications easy, and non-comformant applications possible.
* Seamless interoperability with non-Rust applications via Rust's FFI.

## Non-goals

* This library is not meant for implementing DNP3 outstations on microcontrollers. The library supports platforms and architectures supported by Rust
and the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) Runtime. This generally means major operating systems with first class support for x86/x64 and 64-bit ARM.
* Uncommon and/or unsound protocol features are not implemented. Secure authentication version v2 or v5 will never be implemented in this library and we discourage
others from using them in production environments. TLS is always a better choice when IP communications is available. Secure authentication version 6 *may*
be implemented in the future if the design proves to be sound.
