DNP3 defines four subset levels for the purpose of interoperability:

* `Level 1` - The minimum features that a master or outstation must implement to be DNP3 compliant. The functionality is quite basic, intended for a small field device.
* `Level 2` - Adds a number of function codes and objects to support a small RTU or data concentrator.
* `Level 3` - Adds additional function codes and objects to support more complex RTUs/concentrators, must notably adding enable/disable of unsolicited reporting.
* `Level 4` - Adds additional less-commonly used features including floating point analog variations, double-bit binary inputs, and device attributes.
* Other features are defined which do not belong to any subset level such as file transfer, datasets, and secure authentication.


### Current Support: Level 3

The library is currently level 3 compliant for the both master and outstation. It will be made level 4 compliant in a future release. A number of level 4
features and features that do not belong to a subset level are already supported:

| Feature                   | Level |
|---------------------------|:-----:|
| Double-bit Binary Inputs  |  4    |
| Floating-point AI/AO      |  4    |
| BO/AO events              |  4    |
| LAN time-synchronization  |  4    |
| self-address support      |  4    |
| Octet strings (g110/111)  |  n/a  |

### Future Support

We plan to add support for a number of features in future releases including:

1. Transport Layer Security - We are currently working with the [Rustls](https://github.com/ctz/rustls) library to fully support non-web applications in the
library. This is a high-priority item for a subsequent release.
2. Device attributes (group 0)
3. AO/BO command events (groups 13 & 43)
4. Analog input deadbands (group 34)

The library will be level 4 compliant when items 2-4 have been completed.

## Conformance Testing

The DNP3 User Group publishes official conformance test procedures for outstations. The procedures validate all of the level 2 functionality. Procedures
for level 3 are currently in the works.


We have an internal implementation of these test procedures that we automatically run against the outstation implementation. These procedures augment our
own unit and integration tests to ensure compliance to the standard.

:::note
The DNP User Group does not certify libraries as conformant, only outstation devices. Should you wish to put your outstation product through conformance
testing, Step Function I/O can assist you with this process as a services engagement.
