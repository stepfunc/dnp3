Rust's package manager (`cargo`) makes it easy to work with external dependencies. This is wonderful for development, but means that Rust applications
and libraries tend to have many dependencies.

Our library only depends directly on a handful of third-party libraries; however, those libraries pull in dozens of their own dependencies. Here's how we manage
our direct and indirect dependencies.

## Dependency Whitelisting

We use a dependency whitelist to ensure that we never incorporate dependencies into our builds unless they are manually approved. During each CI build, the following
checks are performed:

* Check every dependency against the whitelist. Our CI packaging will fail if add a dependency is added with a license that has not been pre-approved.
* Produce a license report called `third-party-licenses.txt` that consolidates all the dependency and license information. We include this document in all of
our binary distributions.
* Ignore projects that are 100% copyrighted by Step Function I/O, e.g. the library itself and some dependencies we share between with our other protocol libraries.

:::note
The license report file differs slightly for the Java library as it incorporates some additional components for the JNI functionality.

## Proprietary Compatible

All dependencies of the library have licenses that are both mutually compatible and compatible with commercial/proprietary products. We don't allow the
incorporation of strong copyleft licenses such as the GPL. You can see a complete list of allowed dependencies and licenses in <a href={`${sitedata.github_url}/blob/${sitedata.version}/dep_config.json`}>deps_config.json</a>.

## Disclaimer

We've included this information because we take open source license compliance seriously. That said, this information and the `third-party-licenses.txt` file are provided for your reference and do not constitute legal advice.
