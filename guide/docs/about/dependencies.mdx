Rust's package manager (`cargo`) makes it easy to work with external dependencies. This is great for development, but means Rust applications and libraries tend to have many dependencies.

Our library depends directly on a handful of third-party libraries, but those pull in dozens of their own. Here's how we manage dependencies.

## Dependency Allowlisting

We use a dependency allowlist to ensure that we never incorporate dependencies into our builds unless they are manually approved. During each CI build, the following
checks are performed:

* Check every dependency against the allowlist. Our CI packaging will fail if a dependency is added with a license that has not been pre-approved.
* Produce a license report called `third-party-licenses.txt` that consolidates all the dependency and license information. We include this document in all of
our binary distributions.
* Ignore projects that are 100% copyrighted by Step Function I/O, e.g. the library itself and some dependencies we share with our other protocol libraries.

:::note
The license report file differs slightly for the Java library as it incorporates some additional components for the JNI functionality.

## Proprietary Compatible

All dependencies of the library have licenses that are both mutually compatible and compatible with commercial/proprietary products. We don't allow the
incorporation of strong copyleft licenses such as the GPL. You can see a complete list of allowed dependencies and licenses in <a href={`${sitedata.github_url}/blob/${sitedata.version}/allowed.json`}>allowed.json</a>.

## Disclaimer

We've included this information because we take open source license compliance seriously. That said, this information and the `third-party-licenses.txt` file are provided for your reference and do not constitute legal advice. Treat this information as a starting point so you can perform your own due diligence.
