The underlying Rust library follows the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) specification. Refer to the specification for the meaning of the `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
fields of the version number when using the library in Rust.

## Version numbers

The following sections describe the meaning of the fields in the version number.

### Major

Major releases are for substantial breaking changes and should occur infrequently. They provide an opportunity to
consolidate functionality that may have been added in an adhoc manner in support of backwards compatibility in minor
releases. Major releases may also add functionality that requires refactoring of the API.

### Minor

Minor releases are for introducing new functionality in a (mostly) backwards compatible manner:

- Rust - API compatible per `semver`
- C & C++ - API compatible
- Java - API compatible
- C# - API compatible with the exception that we may add new methods to interfaces that need to be stubbed out

:::note Why is C# different?
C++, Java, Rust, and even C (via NULL) support a way of defining default methods on interfaces. This allows us to extend
interfaces in minor releases without breaking source compatibility in these languages. Default interfaces were added to
C# 8.0, however to target .NET standard 2.0 (which is both .NET Core and .NET Framework compatible) we can only use C# 7.
:::

### Patch

Patch releases are only for fixing bugs that cannot wait for a minor release to be resolved. Patch releases,
e.g. 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1, are API compatible in all languages. The C library (libdnp3_ffi.so) will also be ABI compatible
between patch versions.
