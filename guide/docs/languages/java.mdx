The Java bindings are distributed as a JAR targeting Java 8. Native libraries for Windows and Linux are embedded in the JAR's `resources` directory. The
correct native library will automatically load during static initialization. These native libraries wrap the underlying C API with a thin layer of
[JNI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jni/).

## Maven

Release artifacts are published to Maven central. Add this dependency to incorporate them into your projects:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.stepfunc</groupId>
    <artifactId>dnp3</artifactId>
    <version>${dnp3.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

## Dependencies

In addition to the Rust dependencies, the Java bindings depend on these two open source projects:

* [joou-java-6](https://github.com/jOOQ/jOOU) - Apache 2.0 - Java Object Oriented Unsigned (JOOU) integer classes
* [commons-lang3](https://github.com/apache/commons-lang) - Apache 2.0 - Java utility classes

These libraries are not distributed by Step Function I/O directly. They are only declared as a dependency for the package manager to retrieve.

## Unsigned Integers

Java doesn't support unsigned integers as part of the core language. Instead, the Java code generator uses classes from the `JOOU` library. This ensures that numeric types crossing the Java/JNI boundary are pre-validated within the correct range. User code that creates unsigned integers will need to import symbols from the `JOOU` library.

It is particularly helpful to statically import the factory methods on `Unsigned` class:

```java
import static org.joou.Unsigned.*;
import org.joou.UShort;
```

This lets you create instances of the unsigned classes:

```java
UShort value = ushort(65535);
```

## Mapping

Java is an object-oriented language that supports all the abstract patterns modeled in the code generator. This section describes those mappings.

### Errors

C API errors are transformed into exceptions containing the error enum. The exception class inherits from `RuntimeException`.

:::warning
Uncaught exceptions thrown in callbacks will terminate the program. Always wrap your callback logic using `try/catch` syntax if there's a possibility the callback will throw.
:::


### Iterators

Iterators are transformed into `List<T>` by the code generator. This means that the collections returned by callbacks may be
used outside the callback. For example, you can send them to another thread for processing.

### Structs

Native structs are mapped to Java classes. They have public member visibility, and the constructor ensures that all values are initialized.

### Classes

Abstract classes are also mapped to Java classes. They have a private pointer to the underlying native resource. There are two types of generated classes in Java: 
* Generated classes that only have a `finalize` method: These are automatically garbage collected, while native resources are deallocated in the class's finalize method. These types of classes are typically builder objects such as `Commands`, `Request`, and `AddressFilter`. 
* Generated classes that also provide a public `Shutdown` method to proactively release native resources: These represent long-lived resources such as `Runtime`, `Master`, or `TCPServer`. They map to an asynchronous Rust task executing on the Tokio runtime. The `Shutdown` method lets you precisely control when the resource/task will stop.


### Asynchronous Methods

Abstract asynchronous methods are transformed into methods that return `CompletionStage<T>`. You can then chain and use the object in an asynchronous
workflow, or transform it into a `CompletableFuture<T>` and call `get()`.
