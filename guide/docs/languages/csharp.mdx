We distribute the C# bindings as a [Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dnp3). Internally, the C API is called using [P/Invoke](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke)
The bindings are .NET Standard 2.0 compatible and include platform-specific shared libraries that are automatically loaded by the .NET runtime.

Shared libraries for the following platforms are included in the Nuget package:

- Windows x64 (Windows 7+)
- Windows x86 (Windows 7+)
- Linux x64 (kernel 2.6.32+, glibc 2.11+)
- Linux AArch64 (kernel 4.2, glibc 2.17+)
- MacOS x64 (MacOS 10.7+, Lion+)

:::warning
MacOS x64 libraries are included in the package but are not officially supported. They are useful for developers using MacOS, but
are not supported in production.
:::

## Supported .NET versions

The library targets .NET Standard 2.0, meaning it supports .NET Core 2.0+, .NET 5+ and .NET Framework 4.6.1+ (although at least 4.7.2 is recommended).
A complete compatibility table is available on [Microsoft website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-2-0).

:::info
On .NET Framework, you need to specify the platform you are targeting. The library currently does not support the `AnyCPU` platform. You need to
set the platform to either `x64` or `x86` in order for the MSBuild script to properly copy the DLL in the build directory.

For .NET Core and .NET 5, the proper DLL is automatically loaded even with the `AnyCPU` platform.

## Mapping

C# is an object-oriented language that supports all the abstract patterns modeled in the code generator. Here's what you need to know.

### Errors

C API errors are transformed into exceptions that contain the error `enum`.

:::warning
Uncaught exceptions thrown in callbacks will terminate the program. Your code should always wrap callback logic with `try/catch` syntax if there's a chance that the callback will throw.

### Iterators

The code generator transforms iterators into `ICollection<T>`. This means that the collections returned by callbacks may be used outside the callback. For example, you can send them to another thread for processing.

### Structs

Native structs are mapped to C# classes. They have public member visibility, and the constructor ensures that all values without a reasonable default are initialized.
Each field has a `With<FieldName>` method that sets the field and returns the struct for chaining operations.

### Classes

Abstract classes are mapped to C# classes. They have a private pointer to the underlying native resource. There are two types of generated classes in C#:
* Generated classes that only have a private finalizer: These are automatically garbage collected, while native resources are deallocated in the class's finalize method. These
types of classes are typically builder objects such as `Commands`, `Request`, and `AddressFilter`.
* Generated classes that also provide a public `Shutdown` method: These represent long-lived resources such as `Runtime`, `Master`, or `TCPServer`. They map to an asynchronous
Rust task executing on the Tokio runtime. The `Shutdown` method lets you precisely control when the resource/task will stop.

### Asynchronous Methods

Abstract asynchronous methods are transformed into methods that return `Task<T>`. C# Tasks are flexible and can be consumed in different ways:

* Synchronous applications can
