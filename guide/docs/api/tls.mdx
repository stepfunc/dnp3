Masters and outstations may optionally use TLS which protects DNP3 communication by adding authentication and privacy. The library internally uses
[rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls), a modern TLS library written in safe Rust. It does **not** depend on OpenSSL or other system libraries, but will
interoperate seamlessly with other TLS implementations.

# Secure Authentication?

DNP3 SAv5 (and v2) contains a number of [design](https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~sergey/langsec/papers/crain-bratus-bolt-on-dnp3sa.pdf)
[flaws](https://cms-cdn.selinc.com/assets/Literature/Publications/Technical%20Papers/6910_AllAboutEve_CG_20190131_Web2.pdf?v=20191113-212654) and was never widely adopted.
The multi-user support in SAv5 has been [deprecated](https://rlc.vlinder.ca/blog/2019/10/26/tb2019-001-multi-user-sa) because it could never meet its stated design goals.
SAv6 aims to reduce the complexity of SAv5, but it has not been standardized yet and there are no full implementations.

:::tip
We recommend using TLS to secure DNP3 and caution the industry to avoid home-grown solutions such as secure authentication.

- Self-signed certificates (with a special configuration).

## Configuration

TLS configuration is configured using the `TlsClientConfig` or `TlsServerConfig` structures. They are very similar and contain the following fields:

- `name`:
  * The client and the server both verify that the certificate presented by the peer is valid for this name. Check out the next section for the gory details on
  name validation.
  * The client will advertise this name through a Server Name Indication (SNI) extension in the `Client Hello`.
- `peer_cert_path`:
  * Path to the unencrypted PEM file containing the trusted root certificate(s) or the peer self-signed certificate.
- `local_cert_path`:
  * Path to the unencrypted PEM file containing the certificate(s) to present to the peer.
- `private_key_path`:
  * Path to the PEM file containing the encrypted or plaintext private key corresponding to the public key in the presented certificate.
- `password`:
  * Password used to decrypt the private key file. This field should be left empty if the file is not encrypted. See the next section for more details.
- `min_tls_version`:
  * Minimum TLS version to support. Setting this to `Tls1_3` will force the usage of TLSv1.3.
- `certificate_mode`:
  * Mode of used to verify the peer certificate.

### Name Validation

The following information describes how name validation is performed when `certificate_mode` is `AuthorityBased`. When the mode
is `SelfSigned`, name validation is performed indirectly since a byte-for-byte comparison occurs of the entire certificate.

A valid name has the same requirements as a DNS name. This is defined in
[RFC 1034 Section 3.5](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034#section-3.5),
updated by [RFC1123 Section 2.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1123#section-2),
with the additional exception that underscores `_` are allowed. A brief (but incomplete)
definition of a valid name includes:

- One or more labels separated by a single period
- Labels are made of alphanumeric characters `[A-Za-z0-9]`, hyphens `-`, and underscores `_`
- A label cannot start or end with an hyphen `-`
- A label cannot be all numeric
- A label cannot be empty
- Maximum of 63 characters per label
- Maximum of 253 characters total

If the SAN extension is present, the name is name validated against it. The SAN may contain multiple names and each name can contain a wildcard `*` character.
The comparison is case-insensitive.

If the SAN is absent, then the `Common Name` from the certificate's `Subject` is extracted and compared. The Common Name cannot contain a wildcard character
and the comparison is case-sensitive. It is effectively compared byte-for-byte with the expected name.

:::tip
New certificates should always include the SAN extension. Performing name verification using the `Common Name`
is still secure, but it is deprecated for new use cases.

### Private key encryption

Unencrypted private keys may be stored in PKCS#1 or PKCS#8 formats:

* `----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`

* `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`

Encrypted private keys must be stored in PKCS#8v2 format:
*  `-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----`

Keys encrypted in PKCS#1 format are **not** supported.

The following algorithms are supported when keys are encrypted in PKCS#8v2 format:

- Key derivation functions:
  - scrypt (RFC 7914) **recommended**
  - PBKDF2 (RFC 8018) using one of the following HMAC:
    * HMAC-SHA224
    * HMAC-SHA256
    * HMAC-SHA384
    * HMAC-SHA512
- Symmetric encryption:
  - AES-128-CBC
  - AES-192-CBC
  - AES-256-CBC **recommended**

SHA-1 based key derivation and DES/3DES symmetric encryption are **not** supported because they are insecure.

[OpenSSL `pkcs8`](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-pkcs8.html) tool can help you
encrypting or converting private keys.

:::tip
Encrypting private keys when using TLS rarely addresses a meaningful threat model. Encrypting a private key and storing the password in a configuration file
is equivalent to locking your doors and leaving the key under the doormat.
:::

### Certificate Mode

The `certificate_mode` parameter determines how the presented peer certificate
is validated.

#### Authority-based

The default `AuthorityBased` uses the normal `rustls` verifier to check the presented chain of certificates
and verify that the root certificate of the chain is one of those provided in the `peer_cert_path` file.
Most, if not all applications, in the power industry, will have a **single** root certificate.

This mode also validates that all critical extensions are handled, validity of the `NotBefore` and `NotAfter` fields,
the DNS name, and other details. It will **not** accept self-signed certificate.

#### Self-Signed

The `SelfSigned` mode validates that:

1. Only a single certificate is presented
2. It is a byte-for-byte match of the one specified in `peer_cert_path`
3. The `NotBefore` and `NotAfter` time fields are verified against the system clock.

:::note
Name validation is performed *indirectly* in self-signed mode, since the byte-for-byte comparison also compares the internal name fields.

### Generating Certificates

The following OpenSSL commands are provided for testing purposes only. Real systems will use some kind of specialized CA software for certificate procurement.

#### Full CA chain

- Generate the root CA certificate: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./ca_key.pem -out ./ca_cert.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Bend/O=Test/CN=DO NOT USE" -nodes -days 3650`
- Generate the master CSR: `openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./master_key.pem -out ./master_csr.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Bend/O=Test/CN=DO NOT USE" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:test.com" -nodes -days 365`
- Generate the master certificate: `openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in ./master_csr.pem -extfile <(printf "subjectAltName=DNS:test.com") -CA ./ca_cert.pem -CAkey ./ca_key.pem -set_serial 1 -out ./master_cert.pem -sha256`
- Generate the outstation CSR: `openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./outstation_key.pem -out ./outstation_csr.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Bend/O=Test/CN=DO NOT USE" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:test.com" -nodes -days 365`

#### Self-signed certificate

- Generate the master certificate: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./master_key.pem -out ./master_cert.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Bend/O=Test/CN=DO NOT USE" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:test.com" -nodes -days 365`
- Generate the outstation certificate: `openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ./outstation_key.pem -out ./outstation/entity2_cert.pem -subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Bend/O=Test/CN=DO NOT USE" -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:test.com" -nodes -days 365`
