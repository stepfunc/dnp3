The `AssocationConfig` struct provides configuration information needed to communicate with a particular outstation on the communication channel including:

* Whether to enable/disable unsolicited reporting when initializing communication
* If and how to perform time synchronization
* Per-association task queue size

The outstation address is supplied as a separate argument when adding an association to a channel.
