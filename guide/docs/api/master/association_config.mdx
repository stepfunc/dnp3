The `AssociationConfig` struct provides the configuration information you need to communicate with a particular outstation on the communication channel, including:

* Startup handshaking
* If and how to perform time synchronization
* Per-association task queue size

Note that it sends the outstation address as a separate argument when adding an association to a channel.

## Initialization

The DNP3 standard requires that the master perform these actions during initialization before normal polling can occur:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Master->>Outstation: Disable Unsolicited Reporting;
    Outstation->>Master: Response;
    Master->>Outstation: READ Class 3,2,1,0; 
    Note over Master,Outstation: multiple responses/ACK possible here;
    Master->>Outstation: Enable Unsolicited Reporting;
    Outstation->>Master: Response;
```

If your outstation doesn't support unsolicited reporting, you can turn the DISABLE/ENABLE unsolicited requests off by setting
`AssociationConfig.DisableUnsolClasses` and `AssociationConfig.EnableUnsolClasses` to `EventClasses.None()`. The master will then skip unsolicited configuration during initialization, only performing the integrity poll.

## Scheduling

The standard makes it simple to customize scheduling to meet your specific needs. Requests are scheduled on a channel using the following steps:

1. User requests such as control operations get top priority.
2. The system then considers automatic and initialization tasks in this order:
   1. Clear the RESTART IIN bit if previously observed in a response.
   2. Disable unsolicited reporting if configured to do so during initialization.
   3. Perform an integrity scan if configured to do so during initialization.
   4. Perform automatic time synchronization if configured and it observes the 'NEED_TIME IIN' bit in a response.
   5. Enable unsolicited reporting if configured to do so during initialization.
3. Finally, the system will then execute periodic polls.

:::note
Each association maintains its own task queue. The channel uses a round-robin queue to ensure fairness across associations on the channel.
