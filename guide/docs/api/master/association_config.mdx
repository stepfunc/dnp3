`AssociationConfig` configures communication with a particular outstation:

* Timeout for responses on this association
* Startup handshaking
* If and how to perform time synchronization
* Per-association task queue size

The outstation address is provided as a separate argument when adding an association to a channel.

## Initialization

The DNP3 standard requires that the master perform these actions during initialization before normal polling can occur:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Master->>Outstation: Disable Unsolicited Reporting;
    Outstation->>Master: Response;
    Master->>Outstation: READ Class 3,2,1,0; 
    Note over Master,Outstation: multiple responses/ACK possible here;
    Master->>Outstation: Enable Unsolicited Reporting;
    Outstation->>Master: Response;
```

If your outstation doesn't support unsolicited reporting, set `AssociationConfig.DisableUnsolClasses` and `AssociationConfig.EnableUnsolClasses` to `EventClasses.None()`. The master will skip unsolicited configuration and only perform the integrity poll.

## Scheduling

Requests within an association are scheduled as follows:

1. User requests such as control operations get top priority.
2. The association then considers automatic and initialization tasks in this order:
   1. Clear the RESTART IIN bit if previously observed in a response.
   2. Disable unsolicited reporting if configured to do so during initialization.
   3. Perform an integrity scan if configured to do so during initialization.
   4. Perform automatic time synchronization if enabled, and the master observes the 'NEED_TIME IIN' bit in a response.
   5. Enable unsolicited reporting if configured to do so during initialization.
3. Periodic polls execute last.

:::note
The standard does not specify how requests should be scheduled for multiple associations on a channel. Our implementation uses a per-association task queue. The channel scheduler round-robins through the associations to ensure fair access.

The `RESTART` IIN bit is automatically cleared by the master whenever the outstation reports it.
