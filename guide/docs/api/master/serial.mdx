:::warning
We currently only provide serial port support on Linux. We are waiting for Windows support to stabilize in a downstream dependency.
:::

Use the `MasterChannel::createSerialChannel` method to create a channel bound to a serial port. It requires the same serial port configuration parameters as the outstation serial port API.

Unlike the outstation API, the master API opens the serial port API lazily after `MasterChannel.enable()` is called. It will try to open the port
if the operation fails.

:::note
The `LinkErrorMode` is internally set to `Discard` for serial communication channels.
