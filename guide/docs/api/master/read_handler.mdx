The `ReadHandler` interface is how the measurement data received from the outstation is passed to your application code. This callback interface is specified
for each association you create and is invoked for both unsolicited responses and responses to polls.

When a response is parsed and determined to carry measurement data, `ReadHandler` callbacks are executed in the following order:

1. `ReadHandler::beginFragment`
2. `ReadHandler::handle<TYPE>` for each object header in the message
3. `ReadHandler::endFragment`

The begin/end methods provide useful information, including:

* The full header of the response
* Context regarding what triggered the response, such as unsolicited, startup integrity scan, periodic poll, etc.

:::tip
It's common to maintain a list of measurement values in your `ReadHandler` implementation. You can then use the `endFragment` method as a trigger to publish them.
Since responses may consist of multiple fragments, you can inspect the `ResponseHeader.Control.Fin` field to determine if the current fragment is the final fragment
in a response series.
