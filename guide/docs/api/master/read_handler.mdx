The `ReadHandler` interface is how the measurement data you receive from the outstation gets passed to the user code. This callback interface is specified
for each association created, and is invoked for both unsolicited and solicited poll responses.

When a response or unsolicited response is parsed and determined to carry measurement data, the interface executes callbacks in the following order:

1. `ReadHandler::beginFragment`
2. `ReadHandler::handle<TYPE>` for each object header in the message
3. `ReadHandler::endFragment`

The begin/end methods provide useful information, including:

* The full header of the response
* Context regarding what triggered the response, such as unsolicited, startup integrity scan, periodic poll, etc.

:::tip
It's common to maintain a list of measurement values in your `ReadHandler` implementation. You can then use the `endFragment` method as a trigger to publish them.
Since responses may consist of multiple fragments, set `ResponseHeader.Control.Fin` to `true`. This will indicate that the current fragment is the final fragment in the response series.
