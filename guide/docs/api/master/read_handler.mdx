The `ReadHandler` interface is the mechanism by which measurement data received from the outstation is passed to user code. This callback interface is specified
for each association created. It is invoked for unsolicited and responses to polls.

1. `ReadHandler::beginFragment`
2. `ReadHandler::handle<TYPE>` for each object header in the message.
3. `ReadHandler::endFragment`
