The `ReadHandler` interface is the mechanism by which measurement data received from the outstation is passed to user code. This callback interface is specified
for each association created. It is invoked for unsolicited and responses to polls.

When a response or unsolicited response is parsed and determined to carry measurement data, callbacks are made in the following order:

1. `ReadHandler::beginFragment`
2. `ReadHandler::handle<TYPE>` for each object header in the message.
3. `ReadHandler::endFragment`

The begin/end methods provide useful information:

* The full header of the response
* Context regarding what triggered the response, e.g. unsolicited, startup integrity scan, periodic poll, etc

:::tip
It is common to maintain a list of measurement values in your `ReadHandler` implementation and then use the `endFragment` method as a trigger for publishing them.
Since responses may consist of multiple fragments, you may also with to check that `ResponseHeader.Control.Fin` is set to `true` indicating that the current
fragment is the final fragment in the response series.

The example programs demonstrate how to iterate over measurement values to print them to the console:
