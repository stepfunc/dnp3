Master stations can typically communicate with multiple outstations over multiple communication channels. The API documentation describes how to talk to one or more outstations over a single communication channel. Talking over multiple channels is accomplished by invoking the API multiple times.

## MasterChannel

Our library creates a `MasterChannel` using generic configurations combined with transport-specific configurations. It provides a representation of the communication channel and how it will behave. Once created, all channel instances have the same API,
regardless of the underlying transport.

## Association

The standard defines an association as "a representation of a logical connection between a master and an outstation". In this library, you add an association to a `MasterChannel` to enable communication with a particular outstation address. Adding an association to a channel will return an `AssociationId`, which can then be used in conjunction with the channel to perform actions on that outstation.

:::note
It's typical to just have one association per channel over TCP. However, it's also possible to encounter virtual outstations on a single TCP endpoint. Serial channels are frequently part of a multi-drop network where a single serial interface communicates with multiple independent outstations.
