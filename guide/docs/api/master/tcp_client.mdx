A `MasterChannel` presents the same interface regardless of transport. Create a TCP client channel using the runtime, configuration data, and a connection status callback.

## Enabling

A `MasterChannel` won't communicate until you call `enable`. This lets you configure all associations first. Call `disable` to put the channel in an inactive state.

## LinkErrorMode

The `LinkErrorMode` controls what happens if it detects a framing error at the link-layer. TCP is a lossless transport, so the default behavior is to
close the connection. However, you can treat a TCP channel like a serial port by changing the setting to `LinkErrorMode::Discard`.

## EndpointList

An `EndpointList` contains remote endpoints the master will try to connect to. It must have at least one entry; additional entries serve as backups. The channel round-robins through the list until connected. Each endpoint is a `<host>:<port>` tuple where "host" is:

* IPv4 address
* IPv6 address
* Domain name

## ConnectStrategy

The `ConnectStrategy` controls the rate at which the master retries failed connection attempts. The master uses exponential backoff when attempting to establish
a connection. The delay between attempts doubles from `minConnectDelay` up to `maxConnectDelay`. If a connection fails after previously connecting, it will
wait `reconnectDelay` before the next attempt.

## ClientStateListener

The `ClientStateListener` interface has a single callback to inform the application about the state of connection.
