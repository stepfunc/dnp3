A `MasterChannel` presents the same interface once you create it, regardless of the underlying transport. You can create a TCP client channel using the runtime,
configuration data, and a callback to observe the status of the connection.

## Enabling

A `MasterChannel` won't start communicating until you call the `enable` method. This gives you the opportunity to configure all the associations on the channel, as discussed in the next section. You can also `disable` the channel to put it in an inactive state.

## LinkErrorMode

The `LinkErrorMode` controls what happens if it detects a framing error at the link-layer. TCP is a lossless transport, so the default behavior is to
close the connection. However, you can treat a TCP channel like a serial port by changing the setting to `LinkErrorMode::Discard`.

## EndpointList

An `EndpointList` is a list of remote endpoints that the master will try to connect to. It must contain at least one entry, with the option to include additional backup
addresses. The channel will round-robin through this list until it establishes a connection. The list may contain endpoints consisting of a `<host>:<port>` tuple where "host" is one of the following:

* IPv4 address
* IPv6 address
* Domain name

## ConnectStrategy

The `ConnectStrategy` controls the rate at which the master retries failed connection attempts. The master uses exponential backoff when attempting to establish
a connection. The delay between attempts doubles from `minConnectDelay` up to `maxConnectDelay`. If a connection fails after previously connecting, it will
wait `reconnectDelay` before the next attempt.

## ClientStateListener

The `ClientStateListener` interface has a single callback to inform the application about the state of connection.
