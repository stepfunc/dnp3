The `Database` class is used to manipulate the measurement types that the outstation exposes to the master. It is called a "database", but it is really just
a thread-safe data structure.

## Adding Points

Before the outstation exposes any measurement data, points must be initialized. This is typically done once after the outstation has been created, but
points can be added to a running outstation as well. Each measurement type has its own unique configuration except for Octet Strings which don't require any
configuration.

* An event class assignment for the point
* Default static and event variations for the type
* Type-specific dead-bands which default to zero (Binary points have no deadband)

When a point is added, it is given a default value with `RESTART` flags:

*  Binary points are set to `false`
*  Numeric values are set to `0`
*  OctetStrings are given the value of `[0x00]`
*  Double-bit Binary points are set to `Indeterminate`

You may also update the value right after adding the point if you don't want a connecting master to see `RESTART`.

## Updating Points

Point values may also be updated in a transaction. They may even be updated in the same transaction in which they are created. This is useful if the outstation
has local access to values (e.g. via a local ADC) at startup.

The `UpdateOptions` struct allows the user to precisely control how a point update is processed. The default constructor has the following behavior:

* Update the static value
* Produce an event if the point value changes in a way that exceeds the deadband or if the flags change

:::tip
Ignoring event creation is useful during startup initialization if you don't want to create events for the initial values.

## Getting Point Values

Some applications may wish to use the `Database` as a cache of the most recent value. Getter methods are provided for each type to extract the value if present.

:::note
Since the point may not be defined, the getter can fail. This means that in Java and C#, an exception will be thrown if you attempt to retrieve a point that
does not exist.
:::

## Removing Points

Most applications will never need to remove points, but the capability is there in the event that you want to remove points from a running outstation. There is
a type-specific function for removing every point type given its index.

:::note
Removing a point stops the outstation from reporting static data for that point. It does NOT remove any queued events for that point from
the event buffer. Those events will remain in the event buffer until reported and cleared by confirmation.
