The `OutstationInformation` interface delivers informational callbacks about the state of the outstation. While these callbacks don't provide any information that the outstation needs to operate, they can be used to assess communication health or other optional use cases. Examples include:

* The outstation receives a request using a particular function code
* A solicited or unsolicited confirmation timeout occurs
* A confirmation arrives after the timeout or in the wrong state
