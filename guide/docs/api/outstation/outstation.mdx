The `Outstation` class represents an asynchronous task that implements the DNP3 outstation state machine, along with responding to requests from a single master. In addition, it provides transactional access to the `Database` for configuring and modifying the values
sent to the master. We'll cover database interaction in the next section.

In addition to accessing the Database, this class lets you modify the `DecodeLevel` of the running outstation. This can be extremely useful in production environments for debugging communications between a master and the outstation.
