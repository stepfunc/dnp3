The `Outstation` class corresponds to an asynchronous task that implements the outstation state machine and responds to requests from a single master. In addition, it provides transactional access to the `Database` for configuring and modifying the values
sent to the master. We'll cover database interaction in the next section.

In addition to accessing the Database, this class lets you modify the `DecodeLevel` of the running outstation. This can be extremely useful in production environments for debugging communications between a master and the outstation.

:::tip
The Outstation class has the same interface regardless of which transport-specific method you used to create it. This allows you to treat an Outstation operating
over TCP or serial identically.
