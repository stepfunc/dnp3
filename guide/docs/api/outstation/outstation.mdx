The `Outstation` class is an asynchronous task that implements the outstation state machine and responds to requests from a single master. It provides transactional access to the `Database` for configuring and modifying values sent to the master (covered in the next section).

This class also lets you modify the `DecodeLevel` of the running outstation, useful for debugging communications in production.

:::tip
The Outstation class has the same interface regardless of which transport-specific method you used to create it. This allows you to treat an Outstation operating
over TCP or serial identically.
