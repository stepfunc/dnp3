The `Outstation` class represents an asynchronous task that implements the DNP3 outstation state machine and responds
to requests from a single master. It provides provides transactional access to the `Database` for configuring and modifying the values
sent to the master. Database interaction is covered in the next section.

In addition to accessing the Database, this class allows the user to modify the `DecodeLevel` of the running outstation. This can be extremely
useful in production environments for debugging communications between a master and the outstation.
