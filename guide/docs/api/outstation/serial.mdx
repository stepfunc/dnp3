:::warning
Serial port support is currently only available on Linux. We are waiting for Windows support to stabilize in a downstream release of a dependency.
:::

Creating an outstation bound to a serial is done using the `Outstation::createSerialSession` method. In addition to the common components, this method takes
the following serial port parameters:

* path of the serial device (e.g. `COM3` on windows or `/dev/ttyS3` on Linux)
* `SerialPortSettings` struct:
  * baud rate
  * data bits
  * stop bits
  * parity
  * flow control

The method opens the port and will fail if the port doesn't exist or is already in use. The returned `Outstation` class behaves identically to other transports.

:::note
The `LinkErrorMode` is internally set to `Discard` for serial communication channels.
