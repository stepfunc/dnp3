:::warning
We currently only provide serial port support on Linux. We are waiting for Windows support to stabilize in a downstream dependency.
:::

Use the `Outstation::createSerialSession` method to create an outstation bound to a serial port. In addition to the common components, this method requires
the following serial port parameters:

* Path of the serial device (e.g., `COM3` on Windows or `/dev/ttyS3` on Linux)
* `SerialPortSettings` struct:
  * Baud rate
  * Data bits
  * Stop bits
  * Parity
  * Flow control

The method will then either open the port or fail if the port doesn't exist or is already in use. The returned `Outstation` class behaves identically to other transport types.

:::note
The `LinkErrorMode` is internally set to `Discard` for serial communication channels since serial ports do not provide data integrity.
