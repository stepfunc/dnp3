You can bind one or more outstation instances to a TCP server using an `AddressFilter`. Unlike most server protocols, each outstation instance can only
communicate with one client at a time. This is because DNP3 is stateful and maintains event data for a specific master. If you need to support more than
one master connection on the same port, you must preconfigure each master IP address and associate it with a specific outstation instance.

## Creating a server

Begin by creating a `TCPServer` instance. Keep in mind that creating a server doesn't initiate `bind/listen` immediately. Endpoints are specified in the format `<address>:<port>`. Addresses may be any specified as any valid IPv4 or IPv6 local endpoint, such as:

* `127.0.0.1` for localhost only
* `0.0.0.0` for all adapters
* The IP address for a particular adapter

:::tip
`LinkErrorMode` controls what will happen if a malformed link-layer frame is received. Typically, it will close the socket to prevent transmission of corrupted data. However, you can set this value to `Discard` if you want the parser to discard errors and search for the start of the next frame. This behavior is required if you're connecting to a terminal server that bridges TCP to a serial port.

## Adding Outstations

You can now associate one or more outstations with the `TCPServer`. The `TcpServer::addOutstation` method takes all the components discussed in previous sections, followed by an `AddressFilter`. This filter determines which masters are allowed to associate with a specific outstation.
If the filter allows the same address(es) as an existing outstation's filter, then `TcpServer::addOutstation` will fail.

The examples above use `AddressFilter.any()` which allows any master IP to connect.

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Master] --> B[TCP Server ]
subgraph Application
B --*.*.*.*--> c[Outstation]
end
```

If you've already connected a master to the outstation and another matching IP address tries to connect, the existing connection will close. The outstation will then begin a communication session with the new master.

## ConnectionStateListener

The `ConnectionStateListener` interface is provided when adding an outstation to the TCP server. It has a single method that informs your code when the outstation accepts a TCP connection.
The listener only fires a connected event when it receives an IP address matching the `AddressFilter`. If the outstation that is already connected and processing a connection receives
another matching connection, the listener will fire a disconnected event before firing a connected event.


## Binding the Server

Once you've added all the outstations associated with the server, you can then bind the server which will cause it to start accepting connections.

Binding may fail if the underlying socket bind/listen calls fail, such as when another process is already bound to that port.
