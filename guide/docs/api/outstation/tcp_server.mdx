One or more outstation instances may be bound to a TCP server using an `AddressFilter`. Unlike most server protocols, each outstation instance may only
communicate with a single client at a time. This is because DNP3 is stateful and maintains event data for a *particular* master. If you need to support more than
one master connection on the same port, you must preconfigure each master IP address and associate it with a particular outstation.

A[Master #1] --> B[TCP Server ]

B --> E[Outstation #2]
end
```

## Creating a server

The first step is to create a `TcpServer` instance. Creating a server does not initiate `bind/listen`.

Addresses may be any specified as any valid IPv4 or IPv6 local endpoint, e.g.:

* `127.0.0.1` for localhost only
* `0.0.0.0` for all adapters
* IP address of a particular adapter

`TcpServer` creation can fail if the endpoint is not well formed: `<address>:<port>`.

:::tip
The `LinkErrorMode` controls what happens when malformed link-layer frames are received. The typical behavior is to close the socket
as data should never be corrupted over TCP.  This value may be set to `Discard` in which case the parser will discard errors and search for the start of the
next frame. This behavior is required if you are connecting to a terminal server which bridges TCP to a serial port.

## Adding Outstation(s)

You can now associate one or more outstations with the `TcpServer`. The `TcpServer::addOutstation` method takes all of the components discussed in previous sections,
followed by an `AddressFilter`. The filter controls which masters are allowed to associate with a particular outstation. If the filter overlaps with the filter
of an existing outstation, i.e. they would both allow the same address, then `TcpServer::addOutstation` will fail.

The examples above use `AddressFilter.any()` to allow any master IP address to connect:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Master] --> B[TCP Server ]
subgraph Application
B --*.*.*.*--> c[Outstation]
end
```

If an outstation is already connected to a master, and another matching IP address attempts to connect, the existing connection will be closed and the
outstation will begin a communication session with the new master.

## Binding the Server

When all of the outstation associated with the server have been added, it is time to bind the server and begin accepting connections.

Binding may fail if the underlying socket bind/listen calls fail, e.g. if another process is already bound to that port.
