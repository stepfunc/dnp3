Outstations may be created once an instance of a `Runtime` is available. The exact process for creating an outstation is slightly different
depending on the physical layer, e.g. TCP vs serial, although most of the configuration options and callback interfaces are the same.

## Common Components

This section describes the common configuration that must be supplied to create an outstation, regardless of which physical layer is used. Transport
specific configuration is covered in the next section.

### OutstationConfig

The `OutstationConfig` structure contains parameters that modify the behavior of the outstation. Refer to the generated API documentation for the meaning of
each field. All of the fields, with the exception of the master and outstation link addresses, have default values. This does not mean that these defaults will
function well for all use cases. The timeout parameters, for example, may need to be adjusted for higher latency links.

### EventBufferConfig


The `EventBufferConfig` struct controls how many events are buffered for each type that can be reported by the outstation. Space for
each type is pre-allocated during outstation initialization. When all of the space in the buffer for a particular type has been exhausted, adding
another event will cause the oldest event to be discarded and the outstation will assert IIN 2.3 (Event Buffer Overflow) per the specification.

There is no "correct" number of events to configure. There is a fundamental tradeoff between saving events for future reporting and memory/CPU usage.
You should scale your event buffer sizes based on several factors:

1. How many measurements are contained in the outstation database and how often they change.
2. How often and for how long the master may be disconnected or otherwise unable to empty the event queues via READ or unsolicited reporting.
3. How important it is to never loose events for a particular type. For example, it may be more important to never miss binary state transitions
but missing an analog or counter value might not matter at all.

:::note
Setting the number of events for a particular type to `0` ensures that events will never be recorded or reported for that type.

## TCP Server

One or more outstation instances may be associated with a TCP server.
