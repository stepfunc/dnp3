Outstations may be created once an instance of a `Runtime` is available. The exact process for creating an outstation is slightly different
depending on the physical layer, e.g. TCP vs serial, although most of the configuration options and callback interfaces are the same.

## Common Components

This section describes the common configuration that must be supplied to create an outstation, regardless of which physical layer is used. Transport
specific configuration is covered in the next section.

### OutstationConfig

The `OutstationConfig` structure contains parameters that modify the behavior of the outstation. Refer to the generated API documentation for the meaning of
each field. All of the fields, with the exception of the master and outstation link addresses, have default values. This does not mean that these defaults will
function well for all use cases. The timeout parameters, for example, may need to be adjusted for higher latency links.

### DatabaseConfig

The `DatabaseConfig` structure contains a handful of parameters that control static and event reporting. Initialization of individual points is performed after creation
of the Outstation. Users will almost



## TCP Server

One or more outstation instances may be associated with a TCP server.
