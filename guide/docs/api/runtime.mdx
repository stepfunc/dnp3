Rust's asynchronous programming model is a form of [cooperative multitasking](https://docs.rs/tokio/1.0.2/tokio/task/index.html). Once a task reaches
a point where it would normally block (e.g. reading from a socket), execution is instead released back to an executor so that another task may run. A pool of
worker threads inside the executor can efficiently execute thousands of asynchronous tasks concurrently without the overhead of per-task call stacks or
thread context-switching.

Rust supports asynchronous programming using *async* functions and *async/await* syntax. The Rust compiler transforms synchronous-looking code into
state machines that are just as efficient as what could be written by hand. Although Rust has this capability built into
the compiler, it does not include a default runtime on which to execute the asynchronous programs. Instead, users are free to pick the runtime as an
external library.

The DNP3 library runs on top of the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) runtime which provides a state-of-the-art scheduler and platform-agnostic
networking APIs. Under the hood, an efficient OS-specific mechanism is used, e.g. *epoll* on Linux or *IOCP* on Windows. Tokio
is a modern evolution of libraries like [libuv (C)](https://libuv.org/) and [ASIO (C++)](https://think-async.com/Asio/). It leverages Rust's thread and
memory safety to make asynchronous programs that are not only incredibly fast, but also correct.  It is particularly hard to write correct asynchronous
software in C/C++ because of the need to manually reason about object lifetimes in callbacks.

## Lifetime

A `Runtime` must be created before any communication can take place. It is a shared resource for multiple communication sessions. It is typically created just
after initializing logging and is the last component to be shut down. Shutting down a `Runtime` will stop all of the communication sessions that were created with it.

:::note
Rust users may even share the runtime with other libraries that also use Tokio. The bindings currently do not allow for runtime sharing, but it may be possible
in a future release.

defaultValue="Rust"
values={[
{label: 'Rust', value: 'Rust'},
{label: 'C', value: 'C'},
{label: 'Java', value: 'Java'},
{label: 'C#', value: 'C#'},

<TabItem value="Rust">

```rust
{{#include ../../../dnp3/examples/master_tcp_client.rs:runtime_init}}
    // do things within the context of the runtime
    // it is automatically shut down when this async fn returns
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="C">

```c
{{#include ../../../ffi/bindings/c/master_example.c:runtime_init}}

// ----- run your program ------

// destroy the runtime before the program exits
{{#include ../../../ffi/bindings/c/master_example.c:runtime_destroy}}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Java">

```java
{{#include ../../../ffi/bindings/java/examples/src/main/java/io/stepfunc/dnp3rs/examples/MasterExample.java:runtime}}
    // --- run the program using the runtime
}
```
:::note
Prefer try-with-resources syntax in Java as Runtime implements *java.lang.AutoCloseable*.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="C#">

```csharp
{{#include ../../../ffi/bindings/dotnet/examples/master/Program.cs:runtime_init}}
{
    // --- run the program using the runtime
}
```

:::note
Prefer using statements in C# as Runtime implements *System.IDisposable*.

:::tip
When using any of the bindings, setting the number of runtime threads to `0` will default to the number of system cores. This
is a safe default that will lead to good multi-core utilization.
:::

## Callbacks

Callbacks from the library to user code are invoked from the runtime's thread pool. This means that blocking during a callback will make an entire thread
unavailable for task execution. If all of the thread-pool threads are blocked, no communication sessions will be able to execute.

Applications should try to avoid blocking whenever possible. For example, when a log message is received via a callback, a synchronous call to write the message
to a file will block a thread. If this is occurring frequently on all of the pool threads, it can cause poor throughput or even task starvation. Applications
should defer blocking calls to dedicated worker threads, e.g. a user-managed thread that writes log messages to file.

:::tip
In cases where some blocking is unavoidable, it can be useful to set the number of worker threads to a multiple of the number of system cores,
e.g. 2x or 3x the number of system cores.
